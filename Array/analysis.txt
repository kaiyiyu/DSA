Pros:
Random Access: Elements can be accessed directly using their index, providing constant time complexity for access.
Contiguous Memory Allocation: Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it efficient for CPU cache utilization and memory access.
Simple Implementation: Arrays are straightforward to implement and widely supported in programming languages.
Memory Efficiency: Requires minimal overhead for storing elements, as only the data itself needs to be stored without any additional metadata.
----------------------------------------
Cons:
Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, making it challenging to dynamically resize them without incurring overhead.
Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations can be inefficient, especially when performed in the middle of the array, requiring shifting of elements.
Memory Wastage: If the array size is larger than needed, it can lead to memory wastage.
Inflexible Data Types: Arrays typically store elements of the same data type, making it less flexible compared to other data structures like lists.
----------------------------------------
Time Complexity:
Access (Best/Worst/Average): O(1) - Constant time complexity for accessing elements by index.
Search (Best/Worst/Average): O(n) - Linear time complexity for searching an element, as it may require traversing the entire array.
Insertion (Best/Worst/Average): O(n) - Linear time complexity for inserting an element at any position, as it may require shifting subsequent elements.
Deletion (Best/Worst/Average): O(n) - Linear time complexity for deleting an element, as it may require shifting subsequent elements.
----------------------------------------
Space Complexity:
Space Complexity: O(n) - Linear space complexity, as it requires contiguous memory allocation for storing elements.
